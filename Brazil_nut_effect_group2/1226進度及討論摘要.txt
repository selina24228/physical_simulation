Code Debug and improve:
1. assume all nuts(including the big one) has random initial velocity
2. plot the y-component of the big nut and the average of the rest of all nuts
3. Improve the condition that two or more balls may stick together


Things to do:
1. Design that the container has the initial velocity, instead of the ball(e.g., the initial velocity of all balls is 0, and shake the box)
2. 讓球最後不會掉出箱子底部（目前是因為誤差）
