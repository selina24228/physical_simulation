Assumtion:
1.all nuts are sphere
2.all nuts except the biggest one are the same
3.the system is shocked by the horizonal force
Ways:
1.use box as a container. if still have time,use can
2.no friction->friction
3.disscuss for two parameters:different mass and different radius ratio
4.find the proper nut amount
5.maybe can just show the biggest one's velocity and track instead of all system
