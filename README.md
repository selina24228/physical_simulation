# physical_simulation
This repositary contains my two final projects of lecture general physics. <br>
One is the simulation of Brazil nut effect, the other is the simulation of lightning.<br>

## Brazil Nut Effect
This project is down with [shengfongli][shengfongli_link] and [neil1373][neil1373_link]<br>
We try to investigate how object(nut) moves in a collision system, discussing on volumn, weight, and total numbers of nuts.<br>
This project is written with Jupyter Notebook and Vpython. The detail of labor is discribed in the project folder.<br>

## Lightning
This project is down with [yuyuwu5][yuyuwu5_link] and 高為勳<br>
We try to explain how lightning generated, and try to figure out the parameter affect the shape of lightning. <br>
This project is written with Python, Jupyter Notebook and Vpython. The detail of labor is discribed in the project folder.<br>
